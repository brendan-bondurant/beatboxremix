The idea of this project is to create a linked list that the computer can speak back to you. The primary goal was to practice making a linked list. 

This was one of the first projects that I did at Turing, and revisited before the next mod started to see what I've learned. 

This was built in VSCode using Ruby, although I'm not sure why GitHub is saying HTML (at least they are as of 11/24/23). All of the tests were written using RSpec. SimpleCov and Pry were both used frequently as I worked on this.

My goals for revisiting this project was to revisit Ruby after spending 6 weeks focusing heavily on rails, and focus on documentation. I have written detailed notes of how the methods I used work, and why I did them. I will be posting those in the blog of my website as a reference for whenever I may need them. I also wanted to make sure that all of my commits were clear, and followed a specific format. I like the idea of what I was doing, and plan to make a template for myself. However, this doesn't apply if I'm brought on to a project and they have their own way to document commits, but it's good for me to have this for my own projects. 

It was fun to revisit this and see what I've learned, a mere 12 weeks later and this was quite a bit easier than the first time around.
