Beat Box Remix

The idea of this project is to create a linked list that the computer can speak back to you. The primary goal was to practice making a linked list.

This was one of the first projects that I undertook at Turing, and I revisited it before the next module started to assess what I've learned.

The project was built in VSCode using Ruby, although it's unclear why GitHub is indicating HTML (as of 11/24/23). All tests were written using RSpec. SimpleCov and Pry were both employed frequently as I worked on this.

My goals for revisiting this project were to refresh my knowledge of Ruby after six weeks of intensive focus on Rails, and to emphasize documentation. I've compiled detailed notes on how the methods I used work and the reasoning behind their implementation. These notes will be posted in the blog section of my website as a reference for future use. Additionally, I aimed to ensure that all my commits were clear and followed a specific format. While I appreciate the idea of creating a template for myself, I recognize that it may not be applicable if I join a project with its own commit documentation standards. Nevertheless, having a template is beneficial for my personal projects.

Revisiting this project was enjoyable, and it allowed me to gauge my progress. Just 12 weeks later, I found it considerably easier than the first time around.
